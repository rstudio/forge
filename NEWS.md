# forge 0.2 (unreleased)

- Prefixed all parameters with `.`.
- All function gained an `.id` parameter for the developer to specify a name for the input. This defaults to the developer inputed expression for `.x` .
- Added `certify()` along with helper functions e.g. `ge()`, `gte()`, `lt()`, for common comparisons. One can also provide arbitrary conditions in the form of functions.
- Revised `README` to reflect changes.
